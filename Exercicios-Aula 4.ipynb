The industry we serve accounts for trillions of dollars of revenue a year. It's a huge chance to have an impact by shaking up an industry that's still waking up to the promise of technology. We have a chance to really transform the way a huge number of people work for the better, and bridge the gap between amazing software tools and human expertise.</p>\\n<p>By searching for truth in our customers' data we're helping them make better decisions and be more effective. We are looking for a SecOps engineer to help make that vision a reality.</p>\\n<p>Our backend is largely written with Python, so some experience with that or another dynamic programming language are essential, as is comfort with and interest in cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and containerized architectures. Good time management, communication and organizational skills are a plus.</p>\\n<p>As a SecOps engineer you will be a part of our foundations team, working to build out new internal features and improve our current systems, such as permissions management and a development environment. You'll help with CI/CD projects, and will implement and maintain security best practices. You will also problem solve creatively to design and manage the security strategy across Google Cloud infrastructure and user facing applications, ensuring that any potential security issues are quashed before they begin.</p>\\n<p>At Proton, we hire a little differently. We want to find the best person for the job, not the person with the most polished CV or nicest looking business card, so we ask you to submit an application with a few scenario based questions in lieu of a resume. Your answers are randomized, anonymized, and then reviewed by engineers at Proton; our goal is to minimize implicit bias in the hiring process while getting real idea of how you think and hopefully giving you a taste of the day-to-day of the position.</p>\\n\",\n",
